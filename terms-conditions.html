<p>        The Customer warrants and undertake that all Goods and / or Fixtures in respect of which the Company is to provide the Services are either owned by the Customer or legally in its possession or under its control, and that the Customer is able to deal with the Goods and / or Fixtures as contemplated herein. The Customer agrees to indemnify the Company against any loss, damage or claim made against the Company arising from any lack of authority of the Customer to contract with the Company for the Services, or any breach of the warranty or undertaking given by the Customer under this paragraph.</p>
<p>        Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein the Company shall in no event be liable (whether in negligence or under contract) for: (i) in respect of the Removal Services: (a) indirect, consequential or other loss arising from the Customer as a result of the Goods not being available to the Customer at any time for any reason; (b) loss or damage caused by any event of force majeure including, without limitation, storm, fire, flood, explosion, theft, acts done with malicious intent by any person, or any other event outside the control of the Company; (c) Loss or damage arising from the natural deterioration of the Goods; (d) Loss or damage arising from any act or omission of the Customer or any other person acting on the Customer’s behalf including a failure to declare or false declaration of value (and so that the Customer shall indemnify the Company accordingly); (e) Any other loss or damage of whatever nature, including but not limited to any loss of or damage to any internal parts of any object, unless the Customer is able to prove that the same is directly attributable to the negligence of the Company. In no case whatsoever shall the liability of the Company howsoever arising exceed USD $0.50 per pound per Article, or USD $2.00 per cube foot per Article, whichever is the greater, provided always that such liability shall not exceed the maximum value of the Article or such Article or part of the Goods which is lost or damaged. The Customer expressly agrees to take out insurance for additional cover in respect of any loss or damage which he may incur under this contract. (ii) In respect of the Handyman Services : (a) any design defect in, or malfunction due to faulty materials or workmanship, of the Fixtures whether or not such defect or malfunction is apparent or known to the Company; (b) any neglect, misuse or error or omission relating to the operation of the Fixtures by the Customer; (c) any modification, adjustment or repair to the Fixtures made by the Customer or a third party whether or not such modification, adjustment or repair is apparent or known to the Company; (d) normal wear and tear of the Fixtures, subjection of the Fixtures to unusual physical or electrical stress or any failure or fluctuation of electrical power; (e) loss or damage caused by any event of force majeure including, without limitation, storm, fire, flood, explosion, theft, acts done with malicious intent by any person, or any other event outside the control of the Company; (f) failure on the part of the Customer to comply with his obligations under Clause 9 (ii) herein; (g) any other cause of whatever nature unless the Customer is able to prove that the same is directly attributable to the negligence of the Company. In all other cases, the liability of the Company to the Customer in respect of any loss or damage he may incur under this Contract shall be limited to the total amount of charges payable by the Customer under the quotation. (iii) In either case, nothing in these conditions shall, or shall be deemed to, exclude or limit the liability of the Company for a negligent act or omission resulting in the death of, or personal injury to, any party to whom the Company owes a duty of care, save to the extent that such limitation or exclusion is permissible by law.</p>
<p>        These conditions shall continue for as long as the Company is providing the Customer with any of the Services. The Company may however, upon 7 days’ written notice require the Customer to remove any Goods and / or Fixtures being stored by it from any Warehouse and, if the Customer fails to designate a place for alternative storage, deliver the same to the Customer at the premises from which they were originally collected.</p>
<p>        The Insurance does not cover loss or damage arising out of the acts of government, customs authority or official confiscation. It also does not cover loss/damage of the goods packed by owner and or Jewellery/cash, deeds, traveler’s cheque, plants, gas cylinders, alcoholic beverages, contraband or other restricted items.</p>
<p>        Internal damages of any kind are also not covered under Insurance Coverage unless there are signs of external physical damage. Any external damage must be noted on the packing inventory on the day of delivery. This pertains to any and all electronic items, i.e. computers, speakers, etc. However, electrical or mechanical malfunctioning coverage, excluding automobiles, is available and can be taken in writing at an additional premium of 2%.</p>
<p>        In event of international or inter-continental moves, the Company shall not be under any liability in respect of any claim arising out of or in connections with the loss of or damage to any Goods and or Fixtures unless: (i) a claim in writing is received by the Company within 15 (Fifteen) working days from the date the Customer becomes, or reasonably should become, aware of the occurrence of the loss or damage; or if the claim arises from non-delivery or short delivery, at the time when delivery ought to have been made; (ii) Claim in automobile must be reported within a 7 (Seven) working time of vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>        In event of domestic or local moves, the Company shall not be under any liability in respect of any claim arising out of or in connections with the loss of or damage to any Goods and or Fixtures unless: (i) a claim in writing is received by the Company within two days from the date the Customer becomes, or reasonably should become, aware of the occurrence of the loss or damage; or if the claim arises from non-delivery or short delivery, at the time when delivery ought to have been made; (ii) Claim in automobile must be reported within twelve hours of vehicle delivery.</p>
<p>        Where there has been a failure to comply with any of the aforementioned time limits, the claim shall be deemed to have been waived and shall be absolutely barred.</p>
<p>        No liability for damage to Goods and / or Fixtures will be accepted by the Company unless the Company has been given a reasonable opportunity to inspect such damage. Claims if any, which have been lodged in writing would be entertained by the third-party insurance agent and not the company, under any circumstances.</p>
<p>        The Customer undertakes that no claim shall be made against any servant or agent of the Company which imposes or attempts to impose upon him any liability whatsoever in connection with the Services and, if any such claim should nevertheless be made, to indemnify the Company against all consequences thereof. Without prejudice to the foregoing, all such servants or agents shall have the benefit of all provisions herein as if such provisions were expressly for their benefit. In entering into any contract incorporating these conditions, the Company, to the extent of those provisions does so not only on its behalf but as agent and trustee for such servants and agents.</p>
<p>        Payment needs to be done prior to packing / dispatch by cheque / credit card with card fee as applicable. As a special case credit till the time of delivery can be given with terms and conditions. In any case if the payment is not cleared before delivery the company reserves the right to withhold the delivery till the complete payment is received.</p>
<p>        If any of these conditions or any part thereof shall, in any case, be held to be invalid or to have failed the test of reasonableness within the meaning of the Control of Exemption Clauses Ordinance, such term or provision shall be deemed to be severed as if such term or provision had not been contained herein but without affecting the remaining conditions.</p>
<p>        Work undertaken as a result of this quotation will be done on the basis of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Multiple pick-ups and deliveries are not included except as specified. While every care is taken during the packing, transit risks should be covered by insurance. In the absence of insurance cover, the goods are deemed to be self-insured by you.</p>
